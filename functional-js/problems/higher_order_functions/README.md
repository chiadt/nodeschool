# Higher Order Functions

A [higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) (also functional form, functional or functor) is a function that does at least one of the following:

* take one or more functions as an input
* output a function

All other functions are first order functions.

Implement a higher-order function that takes a function and calls it 'n' times.

Hint: Recursion.

It's ok to use a loop in your implementation, bonus points if you don't.

Arguments:

* operation: A Function, takes no arguments, returns no useful value.
* num: the number of times to call `operation`


## Boilerplate

```js

function repeat(operation, num) {
  // SOLUTION GOES HERE
}

module.exports = repeat

```
